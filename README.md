**Problem statement**

Current LLM evaluation methods are failing businesses by creating a dangerous disconnect between benchmark scores and real-world performance. This gap seems to be driven by four critical, unaddressed failures in testing
1. The unquantified impact of **quantization** on a model's core reasoning abilities.
2. The erosion of **synthesis and accuracy** as context windows fill with noise.
3. The inability to reliably generate the **structured output** mandatory for automation.
4. Widespread **data contamination** in public benchmarks, rendering scores untrustworthy.

Collectively, these blind spots mean organizations cannot accurately predict a model's operational effectiveness, leading to the selection of inadequate models and the failure of high-stakes automation projects.

**Elevator pitch:**

While other benchmarks tell you if a model is "smart" in a lab, they don't tell you if it will succeed or fail at the job you need it to do. This creates a massive gap for businesses and local users who find that a top-ranking model still can't handle their real-world tasks.

I porpose: **ITW (In The Wild) v1** a new kind of benchmark designed to close that gap. It simulates the actual challenges of business automation, where 'good' models are not only academic exercises, but a delicate blend between speed, cost and its ability to solve real world tasks.

* It's built to evaluate local quantized versions with full precision models, so you can finally see the true performance cost of **quantization** on your own machine.

* It tests a model's ability to **synthesize scattered information from large, noisy documents**â€”not just find a single fact, but connect the dots like a real analyst would.

* And most importantly, ITW provides a **Multi-Vector Score**. For any given task, it doesn't just give you one number. It tells you *if the model got the answer right* (its Reasoning Score) AND *if it delivered that answer in the perfectly structured format you need* (its Formatting Score).

With ITW, you don't just know which model is the smartest. You know which model is the most reliable, efficient, and ready for *your* business processes.

**The Fundamental Goal**

The fundamental goal of the ITW (In The Wild) benchmark is **to bridge the critical gap between academic LLM leaderboards and real-world business utility.**

It achieves this by moving beyond abstract metrics to provide users and organizations with clear, actionable diagnostics on how a model will actually behave when deployed. It specifically measures performance against the three biggest real-world hurdles: resource constraints (quantization), information overload (large context windows), and automation readiness (structured output).

Ultimately, ITW aims to empower anyone running an LLM to make an informed decision, shifting the evaluation focus from "How intelligent is this model?" to **"How effective and reliable is this model for my specific task?"**

**Core Principles:**

*   **Ease of Local Execution:** The benchmark should be lightweight and easy to run on a local machine to facilitate the comparison of quantized and full-sized models.
*   **Focus on Business Workflows:** The tasks should mirror common business activities, moving beyond simple question-answering.
*   **Holistic Evaluation:** The benchmark should assess not just the final output but the entire process, including instruction following, information retrieval, and output formatting.

**Potential Benchmark Components:**

1.  **The "Local Intelligence" Module (Quantization and Core Capabilities):**
    *   **Task:** A series of complex reasoning and instruction-following tasks that are sensitive to the precision of the model's weights. This could include logic puzzles, multi-step calculations, and nuanced text comprehension.
    *   **Evaluation:** The benchmark would run these tasks on both the full and quantized versions of a model, providing a clear comparison of the performance trade-offs. The evaluation would go beyond simple accuracy to measure the model's ability to maintain a coherent line of reasoning.

2.  **The "Workflow Simulation" Module Design**

    *   **Define a Realistic Business Scenario:** Start with a central task that requires synthesis. For example: *"Based on the provided project documentation, identify the top 3 risks to the project timeline and provide the name of the person responsible for mitigating each."*

    *   **Construct the Context Document Set:** Create a large context by concatenating several simulated document snippets.
	    *   **Scattered Information:** The necessary information (e.g., a risk about supply chain delays, a risk about team burnout, a risk about budget cuts, and the names of the associated managers) is not in one place. It's scattered across simulated emails, meeting minutes, and project charters.
	    *   **Plausible Noise:** The context is filled with relevant-sounding but ultimately irrelevant information (e.g., details from a different project, outdated meeting notes, general company news). This tests noise filtering.
	    *   **Positional Testing (Core of "Needle in the Haystack"):** Strategically place the critical pieces of information.
	        *   Place one key fact near the very beginning of the context.
	        *   Place another key fact deep in the middle.
	        *   Place a third key fact near the very end.
        This explicitly tests if the model's attention is consistent across the entire context window.

    *   **Implement a Progressive Difficulty Scale:**
	    *   **Level 1 (Easy):** Context of 4k tokens. The 3 key risks and names are present, with minimal noise.
	    *   **Level 2 (Medium):** Context of 16k tokens. The same 3 risks are present, but now they are split into more fragments and padded with significantly more irrelevant-but-plausible noise paragraphs.
	    *   **Level 3 (Hard):** Context of 100k+ tokens (or max for the model). The information is further scattered, and the noise is more subtle and harder to distinguish from the signal.

    *   **Evaluation Metrics:**
	    *   **Synthesis Accuracy:** A score based on how many of the correct risks were identified and correctly paired with the responsible person (e.g., a score from 0 to 3).
	    *   **Noise Intrusion:** A penalty if the model includes irrelevant information in its answer.
	    *   **Positional Score:** Note which pieces of information (beginning, middle, end) were successfully retrieved to identify models prone to the "lost in the middle" problem.
	    *   **Structured Output Compliance:** As a final step, require the entire answer to be formatted into a specific JSON structure, testing this capability under cognitive load.

3.  **The "Automation" Module (Structured Output Reliability):**
    *   **Tier 1: "The Formatting Gauntlet"** 
    a comprehensive gauntlet that profiles a model's formatting capabilities in their entirety.

  

	    *   **Task 1: Extraction & Population (Simple & Complex):** As before, extract data to populate simple and complex schemas. This tests the basics.

	    *   **Task 2: Resilience & Repair:** (As before) Give it broken JSON and see if it can fix it. This tests robustness.

	    *   **Task 3: Schema Generation (New Idea):** Give the model a natural language description of data and ask it to **create the optimal JSON schema**.

			* *Example:* "I need to store information about users, including their name, a list of their past orders with order ID and date, and whether they are a premium member. Generate a JSON schema for this."

			* *Why?* This tests a higher-level business skill. Can the model design the data structures, not just fill them?

		* **Task 4: Schema Interpretation (New Idea):** Give the model a complex JSON schema and ask it to **generate a diverse set of valid examples**.

			* *Why?* This tests if the model truly *understands* the constraints (required fields, data types, nesting rules) to the point where it can create mock data, a crucial skill for development and testing.

4.  **The "Unseen World" Module (Data Contamination Resistance):**
    *   **Task:** This module would utilize a "retro-holdout" approach, where new test data is generated that is statistically similar to existing public benchmarks but could not have been part of the training data. This would provide a more accurate measure of a model's true generalization capabilities
